(* Project language file 1
* For: seanpm2001/Learn-Coq
* About:
* I decided to make Coq the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Coq) as Coq is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Coq programming language. It only makes sense to Coq the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
